# Purchase a listing

#### Make sure your account is funded

Purchasing a listing with the Strangemood CLI is easy as long as your account is funded. You can check your Solana account balance with the `solana balance` command. If you need more Sol on testnet you can request an airdrop with `solana airdrop <amount>`. To get more Sol in production you will need to purchase it from an exchange, we reccomend [FTX US](https://ftx.us/home/).

#### Purchase the listing

Once you have enough tokens, you can use `strangemood purchase` with the listing's address.

```
strangemood purchase EnXZJoYDhr7jTM7B41jRMbb2wXAQLPo93aSCUA7LdcK3
```

#### View purchased listings

If the purchase is successful, the game will appear in your library.
